# Trace Simulator

## Part One
sys1.java is same as Simulator.java (with a little changes), it is a branch prediction simulator with static prediction. (Forward branches are predicted not taken, backward branches predicted taken)  

## Part Two
sys2.java is based on sys1, it is also a branch prediction simulator (basic 2-bit predictor with branch target buffer). (N-entry 2-bit predictor/M-entry branch target buffer)
